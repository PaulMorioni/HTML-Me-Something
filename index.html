                I only did Judo breifly and it was when I was very young.
                My father has his black belt in Judo and was almost an olympian,
                I assume that is where I found my love for it. Judo is decended from Jujitsu and is Japaneese for "The gentle way" do to its largest change from its 
                predicessor, which was the removal of many fatal techniques.

            <p>
                I formally attended the same school for around 5 years learning Taekwondo from the age of around 14 until I was 19.
                I stopped formally persuing my Taekwondo training after receiving my first degree black belt. While I was attending this school,
                they started their leadership training cirriculum of which I was one of the charter members. I taught there for 2 years before finally leaving.
                Taekwondo was originally founded in Korea and is an art that mostly fixates itself on the techniques of kicks above most hand techniques or grappling, although included.
                My Favorite thing about martial arts is the level of control you begin to have over your body. My balence was often the subject of jokes in my family, as i progressed early on
                in taekwondo, I began to have the abbility to do things I know I otherwise would have been unable to do.

        <article id="FMA_ar">
            <h2 id="FMA_head">FMA</h2>
            <p>
                There is only one other martial art that I would feel could be considered as well in this list, that would be Filipino Martial Arts.
                I unforunatly only studied formally for a few months under a teacher before I was no longer able to attend due to my studies, however that had not stopped my personal training.
                Fillipino Martial Arts are some of the few martial arts that actually prioritize weapon work. The most common being stick fighting and knife work in Eskrima and Kali, but is in Arnis aswell.
                The thing that I loved most about FMA was that it stopped focusing so much on legs. While I was doing TKD(Taekwondo) I never realized just how much of the fight was missing, my kicks are phenomenal, but many other things had fallen to the wayside.
                When I started training in FMA I was able to put more of an emhasis on boxing and grappling, especially standing grappling which I still believe is one of my favorite aspects of fighting, reguardless of how short a time it is used in an actual encounter.
