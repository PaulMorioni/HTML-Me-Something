                I only did Judo breifly and it was when I was very young.
                My father had his black belt in Judo and was almost an olympian,
                I assume that is where I found my love for it. Judo is decended from Jujitsu and is Japaneese for "The gentle way" do to its largest change from its 
                predicessor, which was the removal of many fatal techniques.

            <h2>Taekwondo</h2>
            <img src="https://scontent-dfw5-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13256150_10209652279329194_7596308454533081033_n.jpg?_nc_cat=107&oh=cd60f8b84cadf10f447f9a44c29b0b0e&oe=5C62D80A" height ="200" width ="250">

            <p>
                I formally attended the same school for around 5 years learning Taekwondo from the age of around 14 until I was 19.
                I stopped formally persuing my Taekwondo training after receiving my first degree black belt. While I was attending this school,
                they started their leadership training cirriculum of which I was one of the charter members. I taught there for 2 years before finally leaving.
                Taekwondo was originally founded in Korea and is an art that mostly fixates itself on the techniques of kicks above most hand techniques or grappling, although included.

            <h2>FMA</h2>
            <p>
                There is only one other martial art that I would feel could be considered as well in this list, that would be Filipino Martial Arts.
                I unforunatly only studied formally for a few months under a teacher before I was no longer able to attend due to my studies, however that had not stopped my personal training.
                Fillipino Martial Arts are some of the few martial arts that actually prioritize weapon work. The most common being stick fighting and knife work in Eskrima and Kali, but is in Arnis aswell.
